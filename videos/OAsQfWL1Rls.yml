description: "Felienne is assistant professor at Delft University of Technology, where she researches programming for everyone. Her research has focused on the application of software engineering methods to spreadsheets and to programming for children in Scratch.\n\nOne of Felienne’s biggest passions in life is to share enthusiasm for programming with others. She teaches a group of kids Lego Mindstorms programming every Saturday, serves on the board of Devnology, a Dutch developer community that organizes monthly meetings on all things software, and is one of the founders of the Joy of Coding conference, a one-day developer conference in Rotterdam celebrating the joy and art of programming. If she is not coding, blogging and teaching, she is probably dancing Lindy Hop, out running, watching a movie or playing a (board)game.\n\nKeynote summary \n\nIf we say science, we often think about physics or chemistry or medicine. Sciences based on the ‘scientific method’. A method consisting of systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses, which goes back to the 17th century.\n\n \n\nEinstein, for example made predictions about positions of stars during the 1919 eclipse, using his theory of general relativity. The fact that these predictions turned out to be true, validated his hypothesis. Sometimes, experiments which generate date are set up by scientists themselves. In medicine, doctors give some people a real pill, and others a placebo. This can be used to measure the effect of the administered drug.\n\n \n\nSo, what about computer science? What methods for systematic observation, experiment and hypothesis formulation do we use? In this keynote Felienne will explain the scientific method in the context of programming, more specifically, in the context of her own scientific work on software craftsmanship for children."
